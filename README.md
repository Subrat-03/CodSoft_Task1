# CodSoft_Task1
This program generates a random number between 1 and 100, and then asks the user to guess the number. It provides feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low and continues to ask for guesses until the correct number is guessed. The program also keeps track of the number of attempts it took to guess the correct number.
